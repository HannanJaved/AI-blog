                            <p>This section provides a high-level overview of machine learning, establishing the core goal of generalization and introducing the main paradigms of learning. It sets the stage for understanding not just what ML is, but why it's structured the way it is.</p>
                            
                            <div>
                                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 text-stone-800">1.1. What is Machine Learning?</h3>
                                <p class="mt-2">At its core, Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing a fixed set of rules, we provide algorithms with large amounts of data and let them learn the rules and patterns for themselves. The formal definition by Tom Mitchell provides a more structured view:</p>
                                <blockquote class="mt-4 p-4 bg-stone-100 border-l-4 border-violet-500">
                                    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
                                </blockquote>
                                <p class="mt-4">Let's break this down with a real-world example: a spam filter.</p>
                                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1 text-base">
                                    <li><strong>Task (T):</strong> To classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam".</li>
                                    <li><strong>Experience (E):</strong> A massive dataset of emails, where each one has already been labeled by humans as spam or not spam.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Performance (P):</strong> The percentage of emails the program correctly classifies.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="mt-2">The ultimate goal is generalization: the ability of the model to perform accurately on new, unseen emails it has never encountered before, not just the ones it was trained on.</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-violet-600">Supervised Learning</h4>
                                        <p class="text-base text-stone-600 mb-2">Think of this as learning with a teacher or an answer key. The model is given a dataset where each data point is tagged with a correct label or output. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data. It's like a student studying flashcards where one side is the question (input) and the other is the answer (label).</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-violet-600">Unsupervised Learning</h4>
                                        <p class="text-base text-stone-600 mb-2">This is learning without an answer key. The model is given data without explicit labels and must find structure or patterns on its own. A common task is clustering, or grouping similar data points together. Imagine being given a box of mixed Lego bricks and asked to sort them into piles based on their shape and color without any instructions.</p>
                                    </div>
                                     <div>
                                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-violet-600">Self-Supervised Learning</h4>
                                        <p class="text-base text-stone-600 mb-2">This is a clever type of supervised learning where the labels are generated from the input data itself. For example, you could take a sentence, remove a word, and then train a model to predict that missing word. The "label" is the word you removed, but you didn't need a human to create it. This allows models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled text or image data.</p>

                                    <div>
                                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-violet-600">Reinforcement Learning</h4>
                                        <p class="text-base text-stone-600 mb-2">This is learning through trial and error, like training a pet. An "agent" (the model) learns to make decisions by performing actions in an "environment" to maximize a cumulative reward. It learns from the consequences of its actions, receiving positive rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 text-stone-800">1.3. The ML Workflow</h3>
                                <p class="mt-2">Nearly every machine learning project follows a standard, iterative lifecycle. Understanding these steps is crucial for building effective models.</p>
                                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-4 text-base">
                                    <li><strong>Problem Framing:</strong> Define the objective. What question are you trying to answer? Is it a regression problem (predicting a number) or a classification problem (predicting a category)? What metric will define success?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Collection & Preprocessing:</strong> Gather the necessary data. This is often the most time-consuming step, involving cleaning the data (handling missing values, outliers), feature engineering (creating new input signals), and scaling features to a common range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Model Selection & Training:</strong> Choose a suitable algorithm and feed it the prepared training data. The model learns the underlying patterns during this "training" phase.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assess the model's performance on a held-out test set—data it has never seen before. This gives an unbiased estimate of how it will perform in the real world.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Adjust the model's settings (hyperparameters, like the 'k' in k-NN) to improve performance, often using a validation dataset to prevent overfitting to the test set.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Integrate the trained model into a production environment where it can make predictions on new, live data.</li>

                         <p class="text-lg text-stone-700 mb-6">Regression models are used when the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. This section focuses on the foundational algorithms for this task.</p>

                                <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-stone-700">How it Learns: Finding the Parameters</h4>
                                <p>There are two primary methods to find the optimal parameters (β) that minimize the MSE loss:</p>
                                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-base">
                                    <li><strong>Closed-Form Solution (Normal Equation):</strong> This is a direct mathematical formula that calculates the optimal parameters in one step: `β = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy`. It's efficient for smaller datasets but can be computationally expensive for datasets with a very large number of features.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gradient Descent:</strong> This is an iterative optimization algorithm. It starts with random parameter values and repeatedly adjusts them in the direction that most reduces the loss function, like walking downhill to find the bottom of a valley. For Linear Regression, the MSE loss function is convex, meaning it has only one global minimum. Therefore, gradient descent will always converge to the same optimal solution, regardless of the starting point.</li>

                                <p>An extension of linear regression that can model non-linear relationships. It does this by adding polynomial terms (like x², x³, etc.) of the features as new features to the model.</p>

It builds an entire "forest" of different decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. To make a prediction, it takes a majority vote from all the individual trees. This process averages out the errors of individual trees and creates a more robust model that is less prone to overfitting.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Answers the question: "Of all the times the model predicted positive, how often was it right?" It's important when the cost of a false positive is high (e.g., a spam filter incorrectly flagging an important email). <div class="formula text-base">TP / (TP + FP)</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Answers the question: "Of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model correctly identify?" It's important when the cost of a false negative is high (e.g., a medical test failing to detect a disease). <div class="formula text-base">TP / (TP + FN)</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single score that balances both metrics. <div class="formula text-base">2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>ROC/AUC:</strong> The ROC curve plots True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures the entire area underneath the ROC curve. An AUC of 1.0 is a perfect classifier, while 0.5 is no better than random guessing.</li>

                                <p>A single train-test split can be misleading; the model's performance might be good or bad just by luck of the split. Cross-Validation provides a more robust estimate of performance. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into 'k' folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The performance scores are then averaged. This is crucial because it ensures the model's performance isn't a fluke, especially when data is limited.</p>

                                <p>Regularization is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting and thus improve the generalization of a model. It works by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns by keeping the parameter values small.</p>
